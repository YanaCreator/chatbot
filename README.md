# Mini ChatBot

This is a small chatbot project I made to practice Python.  
The chatbot works in the terminal and answers to simple messages.

## What it can do

- Says hello
- Tells you its name
- Responds to "how are you"
- Says goodbye when you type "bye"
- For unknown phrases, it says it doesn't understand

## How to use

1. Run the script with Python:
2. Type your message.
3. Type `bye` to stop the chat.

## Technologies

- Python 3

This is one of my first Python projects. I made it for learning and fun.
